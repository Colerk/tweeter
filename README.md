# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. 

It was a great way to practice some HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express back-end skills. Additionally, I did some responsive design for differing device sizes.

Feel free to build upon what I have here or reach out if you have any questions.
